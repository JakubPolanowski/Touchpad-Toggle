# Touchpad_toggle

This is a shell script that will toggle a laptop's touchpad on and off. The script was written so that the manufacturer of the laptop (or touchpad) does not matter. 

# Installation

## Dependencies 
Requires xinput, which every if not almost every Linux distro should have by default

Simply git clone or download the zip then set permissions via sudo chmod a+x 

#Usage

Simply run the command, provided that there is a touchpad, the script will toggle it off or on. If you run the command in a terminal, it will output what it has done, ex. "touchpad disabled".

Rather than using this command in a terminal, I recommend binding it to a key, such as XF86TouchpadToggle (aka the touchpad media key, provided your laptop has one).
